        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Some journeys are not just about reaching a destination—they’re about the experiences along the way. Last weekend, my friends and I decided to escape our daily routine and head to Pavagadh. What started as a simple plan soon turned into one of the most
            exciting road trips of my life.
        </p>

        <h2>An Early Start Full of Excitement</h2>
        <p>
            The alarm rang at 6:00 AM, and unlike regular college mornings, I jumped out of bed instantly. Pavagadh is only about 50 km from my home, making it a perfect destination for a short road trip. The cool morning breeze and empty roads made the journey peaceful
            and refreshing.
        </p>

        <h2>Facing My Fear on the Hill Drive</h2>
        <p>
            The highlight of this trip wasn’t just the temple—it was the drive itself. For the first time in my life, I drove a car on steep, winding hill roads. As the incline increased, my heart started racing and I gripped the steering wheel tightly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Slowly, fear turned into confidence. With every turn, the excitement grew. The breathtaking views from the driver’s seat made the experience truly unforgettable.
        </p>

        <h2>The Climb and Divine Darshan</h2>

        <p>
            We reached Pavagadh around 9:00 AM and headed towards the ropeway, but it was extremely crowded with long queues. Instead of waiting, we decided to climb the stairs on foot.
        </p>
        <p>
            The climb felt adventurous and refreshing. After reaching the top, we did darshan of Ma Mahakali, took prasad, and enjoyed the peaceful yet energetic atmosphere.
        </p>

        <h2>An Unexpected Twist: Flat Tire Trouble</h2>
        <p>
            Just when we thought the adventure was over, we discovered that our car had a flat tire. Instead of panicking, we worked together, used the jack and spare wheel, and changed the tire ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was tiring, but it felt like a true road trip moment—challenging yet satisfying.
        </p>

        <h2>Food, Chai, and the Journey Back</h2>

        <p>
            By the time everything was fixed, it was around 1:00 PM and we were starving. We stopped nearby for a hearty lunch, which felt well deserved.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the way back home, we made one final stop for hot chai and nasta, chatting about the hill drive, the darshan, and the unexpected puncture.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
            From my first-ever hill drive to peaceful darshan and an unexpected challenge, this trip had everything—thrill, spirituality, and teamwork.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you’re planning a trip to Pavagadh, start early to avoid crowds and be ready for surprises. The journey is absolutely worth it.
